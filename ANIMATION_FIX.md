# Animation Fix for Plan Cards

## Issue
The "Choose Your Plan" UI was rendering blank with no visible plan details despite having correct data flow and component usage.

## Root Cause
The issue was related to the scroll reveal animation system. Elements with the `reveal` class start with `opacity: 0` and only become visible when the IntersectionObserver adds the `in-view` class. However, the plan cards were not being properly detected by the IntersectionObserver, causing them to remain invisible.

## Solution
Two changes were implemented to fix this issue:

1. **Immediate Visibility for Package Elements**:
   - Modified the `useAnimations` hook to immediately add the `in-view` class to elements within the packages section
   - Added special handling in the IntersectionObserver to ensure plan cards are visible without waiting for scroll

2. **Improved IntersectionObserver Configuration**:
   - Lowered the threshold from 0.15 to 0.05 to trigger animations earlier
   - Adjusted the rootMargin to ensure elements are detected sooner

## Code Changes

### In `useAnimations.tsx`:
```tsx
// Lower threshold to trigger earlier
threshold: 0.05,
rootMargin: "0px 0px -10px 0px",

// Immediate visibility for plan cards
if (el.closest('#packages')) {
  el.classList.add('in-view');
}
```

### In `Packages.tsx`:
- Added both `reveal` and `in-view` classes to plan card containers to ensure they're visible immediately while still participating in the animation system

## Future Considerations
- Consider adding a fallback mechanism to ensure elements with the `reveal` class become visible after a timeout, even if the IntersectionObserver fails
- For critical UI elements like pricing plans, consider using a different animation approach that doesn't risk hiding content
